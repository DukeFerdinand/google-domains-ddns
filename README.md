# google-domains-ddns

A simple script I developed to hit the Google Domains API for setting your [Dynamic DNS](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en).

My specific use cases are things like remote ssh accessing my Pi, home servers, and Minecraft servers, but you can use it however your use case needs.

### To Run

1. `pipenv install`
1. `pipenv shell`
1. Edit your `.env`
1. `python main.py`

### To add

1. Documentation on adding to cron jobs
